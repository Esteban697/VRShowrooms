# "Night in the Museum" Nanodegree Project
## VRShowrooms by Esteban Struve

This project was created for the assignment "Night at the Museum" of the 2nd Term of the Nanodegree but
I called my Mobile VR App: "VRShowrooms".

**VRShowrooms** is Mobile VR app about simple and futuristic scenario which takes the user through a journey across the 
latest applications in VR (how VR is now being used). The path is guided by "waypoints" in the form of 
floating spheres for the user to follow and the app will be compatible only with Google Cardboard. 
I used **GVR SDK for Unity v1.100.1** and **Unity 2017.4.4f1 (64-bit)**

There are 7 scenes files in the scene folder of the project. 
The Unity **build** is as follows:

- 0 - Room 1
- 1 - Room 2
- 2 - Room 3
- 3 - Room 4
- 4 - Room 5
- 5 - Room 6

The folders in **Assets** contain everything used like: Animations, Builds, GoogleVR, Materials, 
Models, Plugins, Scenes, Scripts, Sounds, Systems, Textures and Videos. The rest of the files are imports.
